ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
âœ… Loaded and explored the California Housing dataset
âœ… Implemented an XGBoost regression model for price prediction
âœ… Evaluated model performance using RMSE and RÂ² score
âœ… Visualized correlation between features to understand price drivers

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The project uses the California Housing dataset available in sklearn.datasets.
The dataset includes attributes such as:
MedInc (Median income)
HouseAge (Average house age)
AveRooms (Average number of rooms)
Population, AveOccup, etc.
ðŸ”„ Data Processing
âœ… Converted the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
âœ… Added target column (SalePrice) to the dataset
âœ… Checked for missing values and handled them accordingly

ðŸ“Š Model Training
Used the XGBoost Regressor for training.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Optimized model parameters for better performance.
ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation
Evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ² score.
Visualized predictions vs. actual values.
ðŸ“Œ Results & Insights
The model predicts house prices with high accuracy.
Median income and house age were found to be the most significant factors.
